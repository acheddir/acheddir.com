## Where am I?

I'm currently living in Casablanca 🇲🇦. I travel from time to time to Geneva 🇨🇭 for work.

## What am I currently doing?

1. Working at my day job as a Software Architect/Technical Lead.
2. Working on an open-source .NET project template for building modular-monoliths/moduliths that are microservices-ready when scaling demands require it.
3. Developing a SaaS for small to medium package delivery businesses.
4. Trying to post content on this blog whenever possible 😅.
5. Enjoying programming with Go. Still on the learning curve 📈

## I am available for:

- Teaching
- Content collaboration

## Am I available for freelance work/employment/co-founding?

Currently, I'm __not__ available. I'm only considering open source collaboration for now.

## How do I decide about a project if it sounds exciting?
