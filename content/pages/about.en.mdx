Hey, I'm Abderrahman, a software architect, developer, and content creator. I've worked as a full-stack developer since 2011, and I've been transitioning recently to a cloud/solutions architect role.

I started writing this blog, and I'll be posting content on it about cloud, software engineering, and architecture.
Let's learn and support each other on this journey!

## What's the point of blogging?

- I believe you can learn a lot by following other people's journeys. I'm following a lot of other creators too.
- Through social media and public building, I get to meet interesting people and we can support each other.

## What kind of stuff do you find here?

Blog posts, tips, and discussions. I'm also trying my best to start posting video content on YouTube.
