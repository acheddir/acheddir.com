# Using Theme-Aware Images in MDX

The `ThemeImage` component allows you to display different images based on the user's current theme preference. This is particularly useful for:

- Screenshots that need different versions for dark and light mode
- Diagrams with theme-specific color schemes
- Any visual content that should adapt to the user's theme preference

## Basic Usage

To use the ThemeImage component, you need to provide both a light version and a dark version of your image:

```tsx
<ThemeImage 
  lightSrc="/path/to/light-mode-image.png"
  darkSrc="/path/to/dark-mode-image.png"
  alt="Description of the image"
  width={800}
  height={500}
/>
```

## Example

Here's how the component works. The image below will automatically switch between light and dark versions based on your current theme:

<ThemeImage 
  lightSrc="/avatar-hero-image.jpg"
  darkSrc="/avatar.jpg"
  alt="Profile photo that changes with theme"
  width={400}
  height={400}
/>

Let's also test if a standard image works:

<TestImage />

## With Custom Styling

You can also add custom classes to control the appearance of your images:

<ThemeImage 
  lightSrc="/avatar.png"
  darkSrc="/avatar.png"
  alt="Avatar with custom styling"
  width={200}
  height={200}
  className="border-4 border-primary rounded-full shadow-lg mx-auto"
/>

## When to Use

Use the ThemeImage component when:

1. You have visual content that needs to be legible in both dark and light modes
2. Charts or diagrams that require different color schemes based on theme
3. Screenshots of applications in different theme modes
4. Any situation where a single image doesn't work well across both themes

For regular images that work well in both light and dark mode, continue using the standard Image component.
